        "> ### 7. Preparation\n",
        "> Perpetrators plan the genocide. They often use euphemisms such as the Nazis’ phrase ‘The Final Solution’ to cloak their intentions. They create fear of the victim group, building up armies and weapons.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> ### 8. Persecution _(you are here)_\n",
